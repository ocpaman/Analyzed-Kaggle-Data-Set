# Analyzed-Kaggle-Data-Set
In this project, a given  dataset was analyzed and then findings were communicated. Python libraries NumPy, pandas, and Matplotlib were used for analysis.

The given dataset was subject to the Data Analysis process of Wrangling, Exploratory Data Analysis, Drawing Conclusions and formulating the results.

Steps Taken

1.Data Wrangling

 Changing No-Show column name to ‘Absent’ in order to match values meaning in the column.
 Fix Patient ID and trim.
Fix Handicap column.
Delete the Patient ID and Appointment ID columns as they are not required.
Separate Schedule day from time
Removed time from appointment day
 Removed ~, “, ‰, ‡, ‘, ^ from ‘Neighborhood’ column
 
2. Exploratory Data Analysis

Analyzing the data by plotting after cleaning it.
General Informative Graphs were plotted.( Fig 1.1)
Specific graphs were plotted after posing the questions against the data set.( Fig 1.2)

3. Conclusions were drawn against the data set.

Conclusions were drawn from the specific graphs plotted (Fig 1.2)
 

After completing the project, the following objectives were achieved.

Know all the steps involved in a typical data analysis process.
Be comfortable posing questions that can be answered with a given dataset and then answering those questions.
Know how to investigate problems in a dataset and wrangle the data into a usable format.
Have practice communicating the results of  analysis.
Be able to use vectorized operations in NumPy and pandas to speed up  data analysis code.
Be familiar with pandas’ Series and DataFrame objects, which makes data access convenient.
Know how to use Matplotlib to produce plots showing  findings.
